Realtek IOT AmebaD 6.2 SDK Release Note

We recommand the flow items:
1,  Apply the lastest Patch will make your project synchronize with our Git branch code, and will make it easier to analysis some issues or implement requirements
2,  Try not to modify the .c and .h files in default SDK. If you are obliged to do this, add your own marco between your code, and it will make it easier for you to merge Patch
	a) If the .c and .h files in Patch are not modified in your project, just copy and paste
	b) If the .c and .h files in Patch are modified in your project, use compare tool to only merge the difference which are not changed by yourself
