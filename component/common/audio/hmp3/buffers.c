 * buffers.c - allocation and freeing of internal MP3 decoder buffers
 *
 * All memory allocation for the codec is done in this file, so if you don't want 
 *  to use other the default system malloc() and free() for heap management this is 
 *  the only file you'll need to change.

 * Function:    AllocateBuffers
 *
 * Description: allocate all the memory needed for the MP3 decoder
 *
 * Inputs:      none
 *
 * Outputs:     none
 *
 * Return:      pointer to MP3DecInfo structure (initialized with pointers to all 
 *                the internal buffers needed for decoding, all other members of 
 *                MP3DecInfo structure set to 0)
 *
 * Notes:       if one or more mallocs fail, function frees any buffers already
 *                allocated before returning
