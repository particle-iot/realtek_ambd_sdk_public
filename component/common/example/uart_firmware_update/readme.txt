Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
        Here gives an example how to use UART update function in AMEBA-1( RTL8711AM/
        RTL8195AM / RTL8711AF) and AMEBA-Z( RTL8710B) and AMEBA-D (RTL8721D). The UART update helps 
		to flash the OTA image onto the AMEBA board using the UART protocol. Once the OTA image is 
		flashed onto the AMEBA board the AMEBA will boot from the new updated OTA image.

        For AMEBA-1, it is to be noted here that the original default image is not erased when the OTA
        image is being flashed.
        For AMEBA-Z & AMEBA-D, the example supports swap update between OTA1 and OTA2.
        

Setup Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~
        Configuration for baud rate:
            In file: component\common\example\uart_firmware_update\example_uart_update.c¡¨
            Chang the baud rate in Ameba SDK to 115200: #define XMODEM_UART_BAUDRATE 115200

            Note: If you are using Ameba EVB board, please set the baud rate not higher than
            115200. However, if your board supports a higher baud rate, you could set it to 1000000
            even 3000000 to get a higher transfer rate.

        Enable the UART firmware update feature:
	    #define CONFIG_UART_UPDATE 1
        Build the project after setting the above two parameters correctly and flash the AMEBA board.

        After building the software and making the necessary hardware and pins setup 1.3, 
        we should now reboot the AMEBA board. Then you will see the xmodem uart update feature is enabled.

Parameter Setting and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Configure the GPIO of Ameba board:

            Use PA_6 and PA_7 as UART TTL RX and TX pins in RTL8711AM/RTL8195AM. Use PC_0
            and PC_3 as UART RX and TX in RTL8711AF, and change default XMODEM_UART_MUX
            in example_uart_update.c from 2 to 0. Use PA_18 and PA_23 as UART RX and TX in
            RTL8710B. Use PA_18 and PA_19 as UART TX and RX in RTL8721D.

            Pull low PC_2 (D11/MOSI/PWN2) by connecting it to one of the GND pins in
            RTL8711AM/RTL8195AM/RTL8711AF, refer to ¡§UM0048 Realtek Ameba1 DEV 1v0 User
            Manual_1v8_20160328¡¨ document for the AMEBA-1 pinout. Pull low PA_25 in
            RTL8721D; Pull low PA_5 (PWN4) in RTL8710B; refer to ¡§UM0113 Realtek Ameba-Z DEV 
			1v0 User Manual¡¨ document for the AMEBA-Z pinout.

            For connecting the tx and rx pins to the PC we can use a UART TTL-USB adapter as
            shown below. The Vcc and GND pins can be powered using the AMEBA board¡¦s pinout
            or can also be powered separately. The setup with the UART TTL-USB adapter has not
            been shown here as an alternative test setup was used in the lab setup which is shown
            in the next point after this.
            An alternative to connect the UART to pc is to use a combination of a UART TTL-RS232
            Adapter and an RS323-USB serial adapter as shown below in the image.
