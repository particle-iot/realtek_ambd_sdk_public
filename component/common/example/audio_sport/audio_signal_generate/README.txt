This example is used to generate sin waves. Please refer to related AN for further information.

Tips: since we use a array whose length is 48000 to store generated audio data, this function needs a large memory space.
If the tool chain says "not enough space", please try to set configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in FreeRTOSConfig.h to a smaller value.
