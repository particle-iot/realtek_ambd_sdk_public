This m4a self parse example is used to play m4a files from the SDCARD. In order to run the example the following steps must be followed.

	1. Set the parameter CONFIG_EXAMPLE_AUDIO_OPUS_DECODE to 1 in platform_opts.h file
	
    2. In Cygwin terminal, change to the directory "/project/realtek_amebaD_cm4_gcc_verification", 
	type "make menuconfig", and enable audio related configurations (MENUCONFIG FOR CHIP CONFIG -> Audio Config -> Enable Audio).
	
	3. In the example file "example_audio_m4a_selfparse.c" set the config parameters in the start of the file
  
		-->NUM_CHANNELS :- Should be set to CH_MONO if number of channels in m4a file is 1 and CH_STEREO if its 2.
		-->SAMPLING_FREQ:- Check the properties of the m4a file to determine the sampling frequency and choose the appropriate macro.

		The default values of the parameters are pre-set to the values of the sample audio file provided in the folder, in case you are using your own audio file please change the above parameters to the parameters for your audio file else the audio will not be played properly.
		The default m4a file is "AudioSDTest.m4a".
	
	4. Build and flash the binary to test

[Compilation Tips]
	1. WI-FI and Network are needed in order to run this example. If you don't need WI-FI and Network, change "#define CONFIG_EXAMPLE_WLAN_FAST_CONNECT	1"
	to "#define CONFIG_EXAMPLE_WLAN_FAST_CONNECT 0" in platform_opts.h file, then, in project/realtek_amebaD_va0_example/src/src_hp/main.c
	move these 2 function calls -- pre_example_entry() and example_entry()-- out of the "#if defined(CONFIG_WIFI_NORMAL) && defined(CONFIG_NETWORK)" area.
	
	2. When WI-FI and Network are off, the program may not run in a normal way due to the default small heap size. 
	You can set configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE to ( ( size_t ) ( 250 * 1024 ) ) to make sure that ram allocated is enough to run this example.
	
	3. This example needs a big memory space, or hardfault may happen. Psram is used in this example, please enable psram use in rtl8721dhp_intfcfg.c.
