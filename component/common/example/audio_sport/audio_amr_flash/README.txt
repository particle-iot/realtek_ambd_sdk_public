	type ”make menuconfig”, and enable audio related configurations (MENUCONFIG FOR CHIP CONFIG -> Audio Config -> Enable Audio).
	
	3. In the example file "example_audio_amr_flash.c" set the config parameters in the start of the file

[Compilation Tips]
	1. You need to turn WI-FI and Network on to make sure the entry of this example will be called automatically. If not, you need to 
	call it on your own.
	
	2. You may need to change the value of configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE  defined in project\realtek_amebaD_va0_example\inc\inc_hp\FreeRTOSConfig.h 
	to make sure that ram allocated is enough to run this example.
	
	3. In IAR, you need to include lib_amr.a under "km4_application/lib", example_audio_amr_flash.c and audio_play.c files in this folder under "km4_application/utilities/example".
