/**
 * struct usb_request - describes one i/o request

 *  only use PIO, or don't use DMA for some endpoints.
 * @dma: DMA address corresponding to 'buf'.  If you don't set this
 *  field, and the usb controller needs one, it is responsible
 *  for mapping and unmapping the buffer.
 * @length: Length of that data
 * @no_interrupt: If true, hints that no completion irq is needed.
 *  Helpful sometimes with deep request queues that are handled
 *  directly by DMA controllers.
 * @zero: If true, when writing data, makes the last packet be "short"
 *     by adding a zero length packet as needed;
 * @short_not_ok: When reading data, makes short packets be
 *     treated as errors (queue stops advancing till cleanup).
 * @complete: Function called when request completes, so this request and
 *  its buffer may be re-used.
 *  Reads terminate with a short packet, or when the buffer fills,
 *  whichever comes first.  When writes terminate, some data bytes
 *  will usually still be in flight (often in a hardware fifo).
 *  Errors (for reads or writes) stop the queue from advancing
 *  until the completion function returns, so that any transfers
 *  invalidated by the error may first be dequeued.
 * @context: For use by the completion callback
 * @list: For use by the gadget driver.
 * @status: Reports completion code, zero or a negative errno.
 *  Normally, faults block the transfer queue from advancing until
 *  the completion callback returns.
 *  Code "-USB_ESHUTDOWN" indicates completion caused by device disconnect,
 *  or when the driver disabled the endpoint.
 * @actual: Reports bytes transferred to/from the buffer.  For reads (OUT
 *  transfers) this may be less than the requested length.  If the
 *  short_not_ok flag is set, short reads are treated as errors
 *  even when status otherwise indicates successful completion.
 *  Note that for writes (IN transfers) some data bytes may still
 *  reside in a device-side FIFO when the request is reported as
 *  complete.
 *
 * These are allocated/freed through the endpoint they're used with.  The
 * hardware's driver can add extra per-request data to the memory it returns,
 * which often avoids separate memory allocations (potential failures),
 * later when the request is queued.
 *
 * Request flags affect request handling, such as whether a zero length
 * packet is written (the "zero" flag), whether a short read should be
 * treated as an error (blocking request queue advance, the "short_not_ok"
 * flag), or hinting that an interrupt is not required (the "no_interrupt"
 * flag, for use with deep request queues).
 *
 * Bulk endpoints can use any size buffers, and can also be used for interrupt
 * transfers. interrupt-only endpoints can be much less functional.

/**
 * struct usb_gadget_driver - driver for usb 'slave' devices
 * @function: String describing the gadget's function
 * @speed: Highest speed the driver handles.
 * @bind: Invoked when the driver is bound to a gadget, usually
 *  after registering the driver.
 *  At that point, ep0 is fully initialized, and ep_list holds
 *  the currently-available endpoints.
 *  Called in a context that permits sleeping.
 * @setup: Invoked for ep0 control requests that aren't handled by
 *  the hardware level driver. Most calls must be handled by
 *  the gadget driver, including descriptor and configuration
 *  management.  The 16 bit members of the setup data are in
 *  USB byte order. Called in_interrupt; this may not sleep.  Driver
 *  queues a response to ep0, or returns negative to stall.
 * @disconnect: Invoked after all transfers have been stopped,
 *  when the host is disconnected.  May be called in_interrupt; this
 *  may not sleep.  Some devices can't detect disconnect, so this might
 *  not be called except as part of controller shutdown.
 * @unbind: Invoked when the driver is unbound from a gadget,
 *  usually from rmmod (after a disconnect is reported).
 *  Called in a context that permits sleeping.
 * @suspend: Invoked on USB suspend.  May be called in_interrupt.
 * @resume: Invoked on USB resume.  May be called in_interrupt.
 * @driver: Driver model state for this driver.
 *
 * Devices are disabled till a gadget driver successfully bind()s, which
 * means the driver will handle setup() requests needed to enumerate (and
 * meet "chapter 9" requirements) then do some useful work.
 *
 * If gadget->is_otg is true, the gadget driver must provide an OTG
 * descriptor during enumeration, or else fail the bind() call.  In such
 * cases, no USB traffic may flow until both bind() returns without
 * having called usb_gadget_disconnect(), and the USB host stack has
 * initialized.
 *
 * Drivers use hardware-specific knowledge to configure the usb hardware.
 * endpoint addressing is only one of several hardware characteristics that
 * are in descriptors the ep0 implementation returns from setup() calls.
 *
 * Except for ep0 implementation, most driver code shouldn't need change to
 * run on top of different usb controllers.  It'll use endpoints set up by
 * that ep0 implementation.
 *
 * The usb controller driver handles a few standard usb requests.  Those
 * include set_address, and feature flags for devices, interfaces, and
 * endpoints (the get_status, set_feature, and clear_feature requests).
 *
 * Accordingly, the driver's setup() callback must always implement all
 * get_descriptor requests, returning at least a device descriptor and
 * a configuration descriptor.  Drivers must make sure the endpoint
 * descriptors match any hardware constraints. Some hardware also constrains
 * other descriptors. (The pxa250 allows only configurations 1, 2, or 3).
 *
 * The driver's setup() callback must also implement set_configuration,
 * and should also implement set_interface, get_configuration, and
 * get_interface.  Setting a configuration (or interface) is where
 * endpoints should be activated or (config 0) shut down.
 *
 * (Note that only the default control endpoint is supported.  Neither
 * hosts nor devices generally support control traffic except to ep0.)
 *
 * Most devices will ignore USB suspend/resume operations, and so will
 * not provide those callbacks.  However, some may need to change modes
 * when the host is not longer directing those activities.  For example,
 * local controls (buttons, dials, etc) may need to be re-enabled since
 * the (remote) host can't do that any longer; or an error state might
 * be cleared, to make the device behave identically whether or not
 * power is maintained.

 *  an IAD, only the first interface of IAD has its entry in the table.
 * @os_desc_n: Number of entries in os_desc_table
 * @bind: Before the gadget can register, all of its functions bind() to the
 *  available resources including string and interface identifiers used
 *  in interface or class descriptors; endpoints; I/O buffers; and so on.
 * @unbind: Reverses @bind; called as a side effect of unregistering the
 *  driver which added this function.
 * @free_func: free the struct usb_function.
 * @set_alt: (REQUIRED) Reconfigures altsettings; function drivers may
 *  initialize usb_ep.driver data at this time (when it is used).
 *  Note that setting an interface to its current altsetting resets
 *  interface state, and that all interfaces have a disabled state.
 * @get_alt: Returns the active altsetting.  If this is not provided,
 *  then only altsetting zero is supported.
 * @disable: (REQUIRED) Indicates the function should be disabled.  Reasons
 *  include host resetting or reconfiguring the gadget, and disconnection.
 * @setup: Used for interface-specific control requests.
 * @suspend: Notifies functions when the host stops sending USB traffic.
 * @resume: Notifies functions when the host restarts USB traffic.
 * @get_status: Returns function status as a reply to
 *  GetStatus() request when the recipient is Interface.
 * @func_suspend: callback to be called when
 *  SetFeature(FUNCTION_SUSPEND) is reseived
 *
 * A single USB function uses one or more interfaces, and should in most
 * cases support operation at both full and high speeds.  Each function is
 * associated by @usb_add_function() with a one configuration; that function
 * causes @bind() to be called so resources can be allocated as part of
 * setting up a gadget driver.  Those resources include endpoints, which
 * should be allocated using @usb_ep_autoconfig().
 *
 * To support dual speed operation, a function driver provides descriptors
 * for both high and full speed operation.  Except in rare cases that don't
 * involve bulk endpoints, each speed needs different endpoint descriptors.
 *
 * Function drivers choose their own strategies for managing instance data.
 * The simplest strategy just declares it "static', which means the function
 * can only be activated once.  If the function needs to be exposed in more
 * than one configuration at a given speed, it needs to support multiple
 * usb_function structures (one for each configuration).
 *
 * A more complex strategy might encapsulate a @usb_function structure inside
 * a driver-specific instance structure to allows multiple activations.  An
 * example of multiple activations might be a CDC ACM function that supports
 * two or more distinct instances within the same configuration, providing
 * several independent logical data links to a USB host.

 *
 * This tells the device controller to perform the specified request through

 * including being canceled by usb_ep_dequeue(), the request's completion
 * routine is called to return the request to the driver.  Any endpoint
 * (except control endpoints like ep0) may have more than one transfer
 * request queued; they complete in FIFO order.  Once a gadget driver
 * submits a request, that request may not be examined or modified until it
 * is given back to that driver through the completion callback.
 *
 * Each request is turned into one or more packets.  The controller driver
 * never merges adjacent requests into the same packet.  OUT transfers
 * will sometimes use data that's already buffered in the hardware.
 * Drivers can rely on the fact that the first byte of the request's buffer
 * always corresponds to the first byte of some USB packet, for both
 * IN and OUT transfers.
 *
 * Bulk endpoints can queue any amount of data; the transfer is packetized
 * automatically.  The last packet will be short if the request doesn't fill it
 * out completely.  Zero length packets (ZLPs) should be avoided in portable
 * protocols since not all usb hardware can successfully handle zero length
 * packets.  (ZLPs may be explicitly written, and may be implicitly written if
 * the request 'zero' flag is set.)  Bulk endpoints may also be used
 * for interrupt transfers; but the reverse is not true, and some endpoints
 * won't support every interrupt transfer.  (Such as 768 byte packets.)
 *
 * Interrupt-only endpoints are less functional than bulk endpoints, for
 * example by not supporting queueing or not handling buffers that are
 * larger than the endpoint's maxpacket size.  They may also treat data
 * toggle differently.
 *
 * Control endpoints ... after getting a setup() callback, the driver queues
 * one response (even if it would be zero length).  That enables the
 * status ack, after transfering data as specified in the response.  Setup
 * functions may return negative error codes to generate protocol stalls.
 * (Note that some USB device controllers disallow protocol stall responses
 * in some cases.)  When control responses are deferred (the response is
 * written after the setup callback returns), then usb_ep_set_halt() may be
 * used on ep0 to trigger protocol stalls.
 *
 * For periodic endpoints, like interrupt or isochronous ones, the usb host
 * arranges to poll once per interval, and the gadget driver usually will
 * have queued some data to transfer at that time.
