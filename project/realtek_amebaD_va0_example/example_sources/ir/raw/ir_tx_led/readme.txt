Example Description

This example describes how to generate specific WS2812C-2020 waveform needed by LED.in led application, to generate led waveform, carrier frequency should be set more than 10MHz
and duty cycle should be set 1.you need copy contents in src folder to src/src_hp.  

TX pin: PB_23

This example shows:
WS2812C-2020 LED signal will be sent from PB23.
